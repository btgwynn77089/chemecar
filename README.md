### [CURRENT FULL-CAR PROTOTYPE CODE](https://github.com/btgwynn77089/chemecar/blob/master/photoresistortest/photoresistortest.ino)

# File structure

There is a folder for each testing file we've created. In it, you'll find the **.ino** file (the code the arduino runs), as well as a .txt file with helpful information. Files that *are not* the prototype/final car setup will include wiring diagrams for the breadboard that make the components work properly.

# Arduino Code How To:


## STEP 1: SETUP/ARDUINO IDE

The Arduino IDE is the easiest way to interact with the Arduino board. If you do not have it on your machine, you can find it for your system [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).


## STEP 2: Obtaining Code

If you are using the current working prototype (if the contest happened in 10 minutes what code would be running on the car), that file is **always** located at [here](https://github.com/btgwynn77089/chemecar/blob/master/prototype/prototype.ino). you can download by copy and pasting the code into an Arduino sketch in the Arduino IDE, or clicking the download file, and double-clicking on the file to open it in the Arduino IDE.

If you are testing a discrete/specific functionality, e.g. the motor signal or the photoresistor input, there's a chance we have a specific test file for that component. Look above the README box to find the code!





There is no way of knowing what code is currently on the Arduino. To "burn" the code (like burning music to a CD) to the Arduino, press the Upload button (right-facing arrow) in the top right area of the IDE. This will ensure that the code you're looking at is running on the Arduino. Do this every time you want to test a file!
